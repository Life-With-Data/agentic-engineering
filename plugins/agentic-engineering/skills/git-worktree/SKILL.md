# Git Worktree Manager

This skill provides a unified interface for managing Git worktrees across your development workflow. Whether you're reviewing PRs in isolation or working on features in parallel, this skill handles all the complexity.

## What This Skill Does

- **Create worktrees** from main branch with clear branch names
- **List worktrees** with current status
- **Switch between worktrees** for parallel work
- **Clean up completed worktrees** automatically
- **Interactive confirmations** at each step
- **Automatic .gitignore management** for worktree directory
- **Automatic .env file copying** from main repo to new worktrees

## CRITICAL: Always Use the Manager Script

**NEVER call `git worktree add` directly.** Always use the `worktree-manager.sh` script.

The script handles critical setup that raw git commands don't:
1. Copies `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.test`, etc. from main repo
2. Ensures `.worktrees` is in `.gitignore`
3. Creates consistent directory structure

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Always use the script
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh create feature-name

# ❌ WRONG - Never do this directly
git worktree add .worktrees/feature-name -b feature-name main
```

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill in these scenarios:

1. **Code Review (`/workflows:review`)**: If NOT already on the target branch (PR branch or requested branch), offer worktree for isolated review
2. **Feature Work (`/workflows:work`)**: Always ask if user wants parallel worktree or live branch work
3. **Parallel Development**: When working on multiple features simultaneously
4. **Cleanup**: After completing work in a worktree

## How to Use

### In Claude Code Workflows

The skill is automatically called from `/workflows:review` and `/workflows:work` commands:

```
# For review: offers worktree if not on PR branch
# For work: always asks - new branch or worktree?
```

### Manual Usage

You can also invoke the skill directly from bash:

```bash
# Create a new worktree (copies .env files automatically)
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh create feature-login

# List all worktrees
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh list

# Switch to a worktree
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh switch feature-login

# Copy .env files to an existing worktree (if they weren't copied)
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh copy-env feature-login

# Clean up completed worktrees
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh cleanup
```

## Commands

### `create <branch-name> [from-branch]`

Creates a new worktree with the given branch name.

**Options:**
- `branch-name` (required): The name for the new branch and worktree
- `from-branch` (optional): Base branch to create from (defaults to `main`)

**Example:**
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh create feature-login
```

**What happens:**
1. Checks if worktree already exists
2. Updates the base branch from remote
3. Creates new worktree and branch
4. **Copies all .env files from main repo** (.env, .env.local, .env.test, etc.)
5. Shows path for cd-ing to the worktree

### `list` or `ls`

Lists all available worktrees with their branches and current status.

**Example:**
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh list
```

**Output shows:**
- Worktree name
- Branch name
- Which is current (marked with ✓)
- Main repo status

### `switch <name>` or `go <name>`

Switches to an existing worktree and cd's into it.

**Example:**
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh switch feature-login
```

**Optional:**
- If name not provided, lists available worktrees and prompts for selection

### `cleanup` or `clean`

Interactively cleans up inactive worktrees with confirmation.

**Example:**
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh cleanup
```

**What happens:**
1. Lists all inactive worktrees
2. Asks for confirmation
3. Removes selected worktrees
4. Cleans up empty directories

> **Warning:** `cleanup` force-removes EVERY inactive worktree regardless of merge status,
> so it can discard unmerged parallel work. For unattended runs, prefer `gc`.

### `gc` (safe, non-interactive reap of merged worktrees)

Reaps only worktrees that are safe to drop — no prompts — so it can run at the end of a
parallel/swarm session or from a git `post-merge` hook. A worktree is reaped only when it is
fully merged into the base branch, has a clean tree, and has been idle for the grace window;
the orphaned local branch is deleted too.

**Example:**
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh gc
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh gc develop   # base = develop
```

**A worktree is reaped only when ALL hold:**
1. It lives under `.worktrees/` (never the main tree)
2. It is not the worktree `gc` is running from
3. Its working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes)
4. It is fully merged into the base — `git cherry <base> <branch>` shows no `+` commits
   (patch-equivalence catches squash/rebase merges where SHAs differ); a brand-new empty
   branch (no commits) is left alone
5. It is idle — nothing outside `node_modules`/`.git` modified in the last grace window

**Configuration (env vars):**
- `WORKTREE_GC=0` — skip GC entirely
- `WORKTREE_GC_GRACE_MIN` — idle window in minutes (default `30`)
- `WORKTREE_GC_BASE` — base branch when no argument is passed (default `origin/main`,
  falling back to local `main`)

**Wiring it into a git `post-merge` hook** (auto-reap at `git pull`/`git merge` time):
```bash
# .git/hooks/post-merge
#!/bin/sh
bash "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.worktrees/../<plugin-path>/scripts/worktree-manager.sh" gc
```
`gc` always exits 0, so it never fails the surrounding git operation.

### Session-start stale advisory (automatic)

`gc` reaps merged worktrees in the background, but it can't warn a human who
*opens or resumes a session inside* a worktree whose branch has already merged —
a dead worktree that will never receive further changes, yet work keeps
happening on it. The plugin's `SessionStart` hook
(`scripts/worktree-stale-advisor.py`) closes that gap: when a session starts
inside `.worktrees/<name>` and that branch is fully merged into the base
(detected with `git cherry`, so squash/rebase merges are caught), it emits a
one-line, non-blocking advisory to start fresh and how to remove the stale
worktree. It never deletes anything, pays no cost on the main tree, stays silent
unless the current worktree is genuinely stale, and honors `WORKTREE_GC_BASE`
(shared with `gc`). Nothing to configure — installing the plugin activates it.

## Workflow Examples

### Code Review with Worktree

```bash
# Claude Code recognizes you're not on the PR branch
# Offers: "Use worktree for isolated review? (y/n)"

# You respond: yes
# Script runs (copies .env files automatically):
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh create pr-123-feature-name

# You're now in isolated worktree for review with all env vars
cd .worktrees/pr-123-feature-name

# After review, return to main:
cd ../..
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh cleanup
```

### Parallel Feature Development

```bash
# For first feature (copies .env files):
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh create feature-login

# Later, start second feature (also copies .env files):
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh create feature-notifications

# List what you have:
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh list

# Switch between them as needed:
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh switch feature-login

# Return to main and cleanup when done:
cd .
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh cleanup
```

## Key Design Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- **One manager script** handles all worktree operations
- **Simple commands** with sensible defaults
- **Interactive prompts** prevent accidental operations
- **Clear naming** using branch names directly

### Opinionated Defaults

- Worktrees always created from **main** (unless specified)
- Worktrees stored in **.worktrees/** directory
- Branch name becomes worktree name
- **.gitignore** automatically managed

### Safety First

- **Confirms before creating** worktrees
- **Confirms before cleanup** to prevent accidental removal
- **Won't remove current worktree**
- **Clear error messages** for issues

## Integration with Workflows

### `/workflows:review`

Instead of always creating a worktree:

```
1. Check current branch
2. If ALREADY on target branch (PR branch or requested branch) → stay there, no worktree needed
3. If DIFFERENT branch than the review target → offer worktree:
   "Use worktree for isolated review? (y/n)"
   - yes → call git-worktree skill
   - no → proceed with PR diff on current branch
```

### `/workflows:work`

Always offer choice:

```
1. Ask: "How do you want to work?
   1. New branch on current worktree (live work)
   2. Worktree (parallel work)"

2. If choice 1 → create new branch normally
3. If choice 2 → call git-worktree skill to create from main
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Worktree already exists"

If you see this, the script will ask if you want to switch to it instead.

### "Cannot remove worktree: it is the current worktree"

Switch out of the worktree first (to main repo), then cleanup:

```bash
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh cleanup
```

### Lost in a worktree?

See where you are:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh list
```

### .env files missing in worktree?

If a worktree was created without .env files (e.g., via raw `git worktree add`), copy them:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh copy-env feature-name
```

Navigate back to main:

```bash
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

## Technical Details

### Directory Structure

```
.worktrees/
├── feature-login/          # Worktree 1
│   ├── .git
│   ├── app/
│   └── ...
├── feature-notifications/  # Worktree 2
│   ├── .git
│   ├── app/
│   └── ...
└── ...

.gitignore (updated to include .worktrees)
```

### How It Works

- Uses `git worktree add` for isolated environments
- Each worktree has its own branch
- Changes in one worktree don't affect others
- Share git history with main repo
- Can push from any worktree

### Performance

- Worktrees are lightweight (just file system links)
- No repository duplication
- Shared git objects for efficiency
- Much faster than cloning or stashing/switching
