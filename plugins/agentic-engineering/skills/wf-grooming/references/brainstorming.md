# Brainstorming

This reference provides detailed process knowledge for effective brainstorming sessions that clarify **WHAT** to build before diving into **HOW** to build it.

## Core Process

### Phase 0: Assess Requirement Clarity

Before diving into questions, assess whether brainstorming is needed.

**Signals that requirements are clear:**
- User provided specific acceptance criteria
- User referenced existing patterns to follow
- User described exact behavior expected
- Scope is constrained and well-defined

**Signals that brainstorming is needed:**
- User used vague terms ("make it better", "add something like")
- Multiple reasonable interpretations exist
- Trade-offs haven't been discussed
- User seems unsure about the approach

If requirements are clear, suggest: "Your requirements seem clear. Consider proceeding directly to planning or implementation."

### Phase 1: Understand the Idea

Ask questions **one at a time** to understand the user's intent. Avoid overwhelming with multiple questions. The interview asks what repository evidence cannot answer — intent, priorities, preferences — not everything askable; resolve factual questions from the repository and state the resolution instead.

**Question Techniques:**

1. **Prefer multiple choice when natural options exist**
   - Good: "Should the notification be: (a) email only, (b) in-app only, or (c) both?"
   - Avoid: "How should users be notified?"

2. **Start broad, then narrow**
   - First: What is the core purpose?
   - Then: Who are the users?
   - Finally: What constraints exist?

3. **Validate assumptions explicitly**
   - "I'm assuming users will be logged in. Is that correct?"

4. **Ask about success criteria early**
   - "How will you know this feature is working well?"

**Key Topics to Explore:**

| Topic | Example Questions |
|-------|-------------------|
| Purpose | What problem does this solve? What's the motivation? |
| Users | Who uses this? What's their context? |
| Constraints | Any technical limitations? Timeline? Dependencies? |
| Success | How will you measure success? What's the happy path? |
| Edge Cases | What shouldn't happen? Any error states to consider? |
| Existing Patterns | Are there similar features in the codebase to follow? |

**Exit Condition:** Continue until the idea is clear OR user says "proceed" or "let's move on"

### Phase 2: Explore Approaches

After understanding the idea, propose 2-3 concrete approaches.

**Structure for Each Approach:**

```markdown
### Approach A: [Name]

[2-3 sentence description]

**Pros:**
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

**Cons:**
- [Drawback 1]
- [Drawback 2]

**Best when:** [Circumstances where this approach shines]
```

**Guidelines:**
- Lead with a recommendation and explain why
- Be honest about trade-offs
- Consider YAGNI—simpler is usually better
- Reference codebase patterns when relevant

### Phase 3: Capture the Design

Summarize key decisions in a structured format.

**Design Doc Structure:**

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
topic: <kebab-case-topic>
---

# <Topic Title>

## What We're Building
[Concise description—1-2 paragraphs max]

## Why This Approach
[Brief explanation of approaches considered and why this one was chosen]

## Key Decisions
- [Decision 1]: [Rationale]
- [Decision 2]: [Rationale]

## Open Questions
- [Any unresolved questions for the planning phase]

## Next Steps
→ the `wf-grooming` planning route for implementation details
```

**Output location:** Keep the result in the GitHub work item. Do not create a
repository brainstorm or plan file, branch, commit, or plan-only pull request.

### Phase 4: Handoff

The pipeline order is fixed, so announce the next stage and continue rather
than presenting a menu: "Proceeding to the `wf-grooming` planning route; say
stop to redirect." Honor a redirect — refine further, or stop for now — when
the user gives one.

## Integration with Planning

Brainstorming answers **WHAT** to build:
- Requirements and acceptance criteria
- Chosen approach and rationale
- Key decisions and trade-offs

Planning answers **HOW** to build it:
- Implementation steps and file changes
- Technical details and code patterns
- Testing strategy and verification

When brainstorm output exists, the `wf-grooming` planning route should detect it and use it as input, skipping its own idea refinement phase.
